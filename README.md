  - This assignment is a report that describes an embedded system design process, components, tools, standards, etc.

- HW2: Implement an application for STM32 using Keil uVision
  - This assignment is a C program that implements an embedded system on STM32 board.

- HW3: Implement an application using Yakindu
  - This assignment is a statechart model that implements a controller.

- HW4: Scheduling
  - This assignment is a report of different scheduling algorithms for real-time systems.

- Final Project: Android app that communicate with Arduino using MQTT
